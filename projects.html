<h2 ><u><font size="5px">TITLE</font></u> <font size="5px">: ESTIMATION OF BRAIN AGE USING CASCADE NETWORKS WITH RANKING LOSS</font></h2>

<ul>
    <li style="font-size:30px;">The aging process of human brain is known to be biologically complex because human brains accumulate damage at different rates,and sometimes the aging process is even accelerated and hijacked by underlying pathology.</li>
    <br>
    <li style="font-size:30px;">Therefore,it is crucial to find biomarkers that can predict who has a higher risk of age-related deteriotion, how the functional decline will progress, and which treatment is the most effective one.</li>
    <br>
    <li style="font-size:30px;">The chronological ages of healthy people can be accurately estimated from structural or functional brain neuroimaging data.The estimated age is normally called "<u><mark>BRAIN AGE</mark></u>"</li>
    <br>
    <li style="font-size:30px;"> Brain age has the potential to serve as a biomarker to explore the brain aging process, congnitive aging, and age-related diseases.</li>
    <br>
    <li style="font-size:30px;">The brain of healthy subjects follows a normal aging trajectory.Thus, an effective approach to brain age estimation is to use machine learning methods on T1-wighted MR images of healthy subjects.</li>
